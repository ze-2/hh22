# What am I? #
I'm a website to let you express how you feel! Don't worry about anything and express what's on your mind. There's an optional section in case you want to let people contact you; but if not, feel free to leave it blank.

Others will be able to read your messages, but don't worry - it's completely anonymous unless you decide to fill in your contact information. I know how sometimes we can't tell anyone around us what we truly want to say, which is why I exist - a place for you to rant, a place of comfort, and a place of support.

You can also leave your support for those struggling; just choose the correct category! After you submit them, your messages will be available for anyone to see. I also contain some resources to help you relax and unwind.

# What was I built with? #
I'm built with Flask, HTML and PaperCSS.

# How can I run this app? #
In the way you can run typical Flask apps - clone this repository, then run
`flask run` in the directory.
